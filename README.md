# Headr
Minimalistic Header made of the most trending landing parts.
I am using Zurb's Foundation Framework to create markup with ease.
So everyone can just clone this project and strat his own site creation with this basic handsome Header ready.

##What it consists of
I've colledcted all my favourite parts into this tiny simple page. So there they are:
##### - Parallax effect
##### - Image Blur effect
##### - Open Sans google font
##### - WOW animation effects

##Overview
###1. Markup
I am using Jade (which I highly recommend for everyone to use) to create landing pages and templates,
so all the DOM you nedd you can find in index.jade file (To compile it I am using [Prepros](https://prepros.io/))
